    "# Introduction to Intelligently Reinforced Image Segmentation (IRIS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we have extensively utilised IRIS, a user-friendly, web-based Flask application developed by ESA-PhiLab, with special thanks to Alistair Francis whose guidance has been instrumental. IRIS has been indispensable in our workflow, particularly in the efficient generation of ground-truth training data for our machine learning tasks. Its intuitive 'click & train' functionality has greatly simplified the process of creating accurate masks for Earth observation datasets, enhancing our capabilities in dataset creation. You can access the original repo at [https://github.com/ESA-PhiLab/iris](https://github.com/ESA-PhiLab/iris).\n",

    "## Installation: Why Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct installation of Iris from the GitHub repository can be complex and time-consuming, requiring manual installation of dependencies and configuration setup. By leveraging Docker, users can easily deploy and run Iris in a containerized environment, eliminating the need for manual dependency management and providing a consistent and reproducible execution environment. Docker simplifies the deployment process, enhances portability across different machines, and ensures consistent behaviour, making it an ideal solution for users looking for a streamlined and hassle-free way to access and use the Iris application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Docker to Access Iris - Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before pulling the Iris Docker image, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Docker Installation**: Docker needs to be installed on your machine. Docker provides platform-specific installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) based on your operating system to install Docker Desktop or Docker Engine.\n",
    "   - Docker Installation Guide: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Docker Account (Optional)**: If you plan to use Docker Hub, you may create a Docker account at [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/). A Docker account is not mandatory but can be useful for managing images and repositories.\n",
    "   - Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If you have an antivirus application like F-Secure running on your device, it may interfere with the Docker application. In such cases, you might encounter issues when trying to open Docker or run Docker commands. To resolve this, you can try temporarily disabling the antivirus application or adding Docker to the list of trusted applications in your antivirus settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed these prerequisites, you can open Docker on your device and then proceed with pulling the Iris Docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pulling the Iris Docker Image\n",
    "\n",
    "To pull the Iris Docker image, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your machine.\n",
    "2. Execute the following command to pull the Iris Docker image from Docker Hub:"

    "3. Wait for the Docker image to be downloaded. The progress will be dis- played in the terminal or command prompt.\n",

For example, if the terminal asks you to open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000), you need to open [http://127.0.0.1:80](http://127.0.0.1:80) instead.

    "## How to Use IRIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find some general steps and tips for using IRIS by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with the Interface**  \n",
    "   At the beginning, you will see an interface like this:  \n",
    "   ![Interface](./Interface.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use the Pencil Tool**  \n",
    "   You can use the pencil tool to paint pixels anywhere within the rectangular region marked by red dotted lines. You can zoom in or out of the image by using the mouse scroll wheel or by using two fingers to swipe up or down on the touchpad. This allows you to adjust the image size according to your preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Change the Cursor Size**  \n",
    "   To change the cursor size, you can hold the Shift key while using the mouse scroll wheel or swiping up or down with two fingers on the touchpad. This action will increase or decrease the size of the cursor, allowing you to adjust it to your desired size.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Perform Classification**  \n",
    "   Once you have finished painting all the classes needed, IRIS is ready to perform classification and generate output masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Show Drawn Pixels**  \n",
    "   You can use the \"Show Drawn Pixels\" button to display only the pixels that you have drawn. This allows you to see which parts have been classified and processed by IRIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save the Output Masks**  \n",
    "   To save the output masks generated by IRIS, you can click on the 'Save' button located at the top of the page. The output masks will be saved in the same folder that contains your data and config file. You can navigate to that folder on your device to locate the saved masks. You are also able to find the corresponding numpy arrays of the saved mask, which may be useful for further analysis.\n"
